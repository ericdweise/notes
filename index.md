This is a collection of notes I have been putting together.
They're mostly for my personal reference but I hope that someone else might find them useful, someday. That being said, they are a work in progress, so watch your head while you're here.

If you find anything wrong please reach out to me and let me know! 
You can find my (limited) socials on my [website](http://ericdweise.com) or you can file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ericdweise/notes)
