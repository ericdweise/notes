# Solid State Physics

This is a collections of notes I've taken studying electronic materials and semiconductors. 
There is a wealth of resources explaining the physics of electron transport, but trying to absorb the information contained in these is like drinking from a fire hose. 
This document is my attempt to distill this dearth of knowledge into a single page. 
To that end, there is a lot of mathematical rigor missing in the more complicated topics. 
I do my best to include the mathematical intuition, but anything out of scope can be found in the references I link to at the end of the topic. 
This is not a one-stop shop for learning about electronic materials, but hopefully it is a good starting point or refresher.

## Electrons and Holes
  When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
  \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
