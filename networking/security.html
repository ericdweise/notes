<h1 id="authentication-protocols">Authentication Protocols</h1>
<h2 id="point-to-point-protocol-ppp">Point to Point Protocol (PPP)</h2>
<p>An early protocol used in dial-up communications The drawback of PPP is that every possible modem must know every possible client.</p>
<h3 id="password-authentication-protocol-pap">Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)</h3>
<p>Very insecure way to authenticate users using PPP. Username and password are transmitted in cleartext.</p>
<h3 id="challenge-handshake-authentication-protocol-chap">Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)</h3>
<p>Passwords are never sent across the connection. Instead, a pre-shared key is used to generate an authentication challenge. This challenge is performed when the connection is initiated and periodically thereafter.</p>
<h3 id="ms-chap">MS-CHAP</h3>
<p>Much more secure, and still in use today. Communications are fully encrypted.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-authorization-and-accounting-aaa">Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)</h2>
<p>AAA is a model in which a central server that keeps authentication information. Therefore, any modem can be connected to by any client. When the connection request comes in the modem just checks with the authentication server before allowing the connection.</p>
<h3 id="remote-authentication-dial-in-user-service-radius">Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)</h3>
<p>An AAA standard. This protocol uses many Network Access Servers, which users connect to. There is also a centralized RADIUS server, which contains a database of user authentication credentials. All the NASs connect to the RADIUS server to get authentication credentials.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-access-controller-access-control-system-plus-tacas">Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACAS+)</h2>
<p>A method for distributing ACLs to many routers and switches. The ACL is stored on a single server. It communicates</p>
<h3 id="kerberos">Kerberos</h3>
<p>This is decidedly <em>not</em> a point-to-point protocol. Kerberos still runs on TCP/IP, but every host connects to a single authentication server, called the Key Distribution Center (KDC). This KDC contains the usernames and passwords of all the users on the network. When a user tries to log in to a host, that host queries the authentication server. IF the authentication passes the user is sent a <em>Ticket to Request Ticket</em>. This ticket expires after a certain time, after which the user must reauthenticate. The ticket can be used to authenticate the user to access any other network resource that they are allowed to access during the ticket’s lifetime.</p>
<p>Fun fact, Kerberos is the three headed dog from Ancient Greek mythology.</p>
<h2 id="wifi-security">WiFi Security</h2>
<p>Methods for encrypting communication on a network.</p>
<h3 id="wifi-protected-security-wps">WiFi Protected Security (WPS)</h3>
<p>This is a relatively insecure method for securing a network. There are two methods for authenticating a new host:</p>
<h4 id="push-button">Push Button</h4>
<p>A button is pushed on the WAP, then a button is pushed on the host. Configuration happens automatically. Downside is that you need physical access to the WAP, or a device already connected to the WLAN.</p>
<h4 id="pin-method">Pin Method</h4>
<p>First a button is pressed on the WAP. Then, a preconfigured, 8-digit Personal Shared Key is entered into the host.</p>
<h3 id="extensible-authentication-protocol">Extensible Authentication Protocol</h3>
<p>A RADIUS server is set up and WAPs act as edge Network Access Servers (NASs). EAP is a set of different protocols used to secure PPP authentication. They are different encryption protocols so that the user-name and password are not transmitted in the clear. The include: - EAP-PSK (Pre-Shared Key) - EAP-TLS - EAP-TTLS (Tunneled TLS) - EAP-MS-CHAPv2 - EAP-MD5 - LEAP (cisco) - EAP-Fast (cisco)</p>
<h3 id="wireless-equivalence-privacy-wep">Wireless Equivalence Privacy (WEP)</h3>
<p>An easily cracked and no longer used standard. Has a static encryption key and a stream cipher that decreases key length. Also doesn’t provide user authentication</p>
<h3 id="wifi-protected-access-wpa">WiFi Protected Access (WPA)</h3>
<p>Introduced Temporal Key Integrity Protocol, an 128 encryption key. Turned out to be just as insecure as WEP. Quickly abandoned</p>
<h3 id="wpa2">WPA2</h3>
<p>Uses Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP), an AES block cipher, and a 128 bit encryption key. Currently the standard for WiFi security. The simplest version uses a pre-shared key, but this doesn’t do any user authentication.</p>
<h3 id="wpa2-enterprise">WPA2-Enterprise</h3>
<h2 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Overall, Bluetooth is not very secure. It has evolved some security measures, including encrypted communications, discovery mode, and PINs, but it is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, not secure.</p>
<h3 id="attacks-against-bluetooth">Attacks Against Bluetooth</h3>
<h4 id="bluejacking">Bluejacking</h4>
<p>Sending unsolicited messages to a bluetooth device.</p>
<h4 id="buesnarfing">Buesnarfing</h4>
<p>Stealing information from a bluetooth device.</p>
<h4 id="blueborne">BlueBorne</h4>
<p>A set of security vulnerabilities in Bluetooth devices. Read the report <a href="https://www.armis.com/blueborne/">here</a></p>
<h2 id="passwords">Passwords</h2>
<ul>
<li>Should be changed periodically (monthly)</li>
<li>Should not be allowed to repeate passwords (within a year)</li>
<li>Should be complex:
<ul>
<li>At least 8 characters</li>
<li>Upper and lower case letters</li>
<li>numbers</li>
<li>Special characters (like !, @, #, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
