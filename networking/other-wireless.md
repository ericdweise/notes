# Other Wireless Standards



## Bluetooth
Overall, Bluetooth is not very secure.
It has evolved some security measures, including encrypted communications, discovery mode, and PINs, but it is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, not secure.

### Attacks Against Bluetooth
#### Bluejacking
Sending unsolicited messages to a bluetooth device.

#### Buesnarfing
Stealing information from a bluetooth device.

#### BlueBorne
A set of security vulnerabilities in Bluetooth devices.

## Near Field Communication (NFC)
- Used mainly for wireless payments
- Target device is unpowered, radio power is generated by the reader
- 13.56 MHz band
- Example: a credit card with touch pay
- Has basic encryption
- Usually operates over less than 5 cm


## Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
- Used mainly for inventory control
- Target device is unpowered, radio power is generated by the reader
- Very large range of frequencies used: 120 KHz - 10 GHz
- Uses weak encryption or non at all
- Longer range than NFC


## Z-Wave
- Competes with Zigbee
- Used in home automation
- Proprietary
- Mesh network with a hub


## Zigbee
- Competes with Z-Wave
- Used in home automation
- Open Standard
- Mesh network with a hub


## Adaptive Netowrk Technology (ANT+)
- Target device is unpowered, radio power is generated by the reader
- Lower power than Bluetooth
- Used in heart monitors and gym equipment
- Uses AES encryotion
